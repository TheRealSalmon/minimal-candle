# minimal-candle

I felt the examples at https://github.com/huggingface/candle/tree/main/candle-examples/examples were still too complicated. I wanted to refactor an LLM example in a way I could better understand. So I created this repo!

Here is an example conversation with OpenChat_3.5:
```bash
> hello!
Hello! How can I help you today? If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask.
> what is an llm?
An LLM, or Large Language Model, is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to process and generate human-like text. These models are typically based on deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, and are trained on large datasets of text to learn the structure, patterns, and semantics of language. LLMs can be used for various natural language processing tasks, including translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, question-answering, and more. One popular example of an LLM is OpenAI's GPT (short for Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series of models, including the current state-of-the-art model, GPT-4.
> what is synthetic organic chemistry?
Synthetic organic chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that focuses on the design, synthesis, and study of organic compounds. Organic chemistry is the study of carbon-based compounds, which include hydrocarbons, alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, and many others. Synthetic organic chemists aim to create new compounds with specific structures or properties through chemical reactions and manipulation of existing compounds. These synthesized compounds can have various practical applications, such as in pharmaceuticals, materials science, agrochemicals, and other industries. The field combines principles from organic chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, and biochemistry to develop novel synthetic methods and optimize the production of desired products.
> what topics have we discussed so far?
We have discussed two topics so far:

1. LLM (Large Language Model): A type of artificial intelligence model designed to process and generate human-like text, based on deep learning techniques such as neural networks, trained on large datasets of text to learn language structure, patterns, and semantics. Examples include OpenAI's GPT series of models.
2. Synthetic organic chemistry: A sub-discipline of chemistry that focuses on designing, synthesizing, and studying carbon-based compounds, with practical applications in fields such as pharmaceuticals, materials science, and agrochemicals. The field combines principles from organic chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, and biochemistry to develop new synthetic methods and optimize product production.
